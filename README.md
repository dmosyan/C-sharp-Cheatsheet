## String
The string is a sequence of characters surrounded with double quotes. A string class in C# is an object of type System.String. The String class in C# represents a string.
String class defined in the .NET base class library represents text as a series of Unicode characters. The String class provides methods and properties to work with strings.

The String class has methods to clone a string, compare strings, concatenate strings, and copy strings. This class also provides methods to find a substring in a string, find the index of a character or substring, replace characters, split a string, trim a string, and add padding to a string.
The string class also provides methods to convert a string's characters to uppercase or lowercase.
```csharp
string firstName = "David";
string lastName = "Mosyan";
```

### Concatenating
To concatenate string variables, you can use the 
**+** or **+=** operators, **string interpolation** or **the String.Format, String.Concat, String.Join** or **StringBuilder.Append** methods. 
The + operator is easy to use and makes for intuitive code. Even if you use several + operators in one statement, the string content is copied only once.
The following code shows examples of using the + and += operators to concatenate strings:

```csharp
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // + operator
string fullName = string fullName = string.Format("{0} {1}", firstName, lastName); // .Format method
string fullName = $"My name is {firstName} and my last name is {lastName}."; // Interpolation

string[] words = { "The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog." };
string unreadablePhrase = string.Concat(words);
Console.WriteLine(unreadablePhrase); //The output is " Thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog. "
```
Use **String.Join** method if source strings should be separated by a delimeter.
```csharp
string[] words = { "The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog." };
string readablePhrase = string.Join(" ", words);
Console.WriteLine(readablePhrase); // The output is " The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. "
```
In other cases you may be combining strings in a loop, where you don't know how many source strings you are combining,
and the actual number of source strings may be quite large. The **StringBuilder** class was designed for these scenarios.
The following code uses the **Append** method of the **StringBuilder** class to concatenate strings.

```csharp
var sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)
{
    sb.AppendLine(i.ToString());
}
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
```

### Parsing strings to convert them to DateTime objects 
```csharp
string dateInput = "Jan 1, 2009";
DateTime parsedDate = DateTime.Parse(dateInput);
Console.WriteLine(parsedDate);
// Displays the following output on a system whose culture is en-US:
//       1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM
```
You can read more about Parsing strings to convert them to DateTime objects [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime#code-try-0) 

In C#, the string keyword is an alias for [String](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=netframework-4.8). Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming convention you prefer. 

## DateTime

DateTime is a structure of value Type like int, double etc. It is available in System namespace and present in mscorlib.dll assembly. It implements interfaces like IComparable, IFormattable, IConvertible, ISerializable, IComparable, IEquatable. 
```csharp
public struct DateTime : IComparable, IFormattable, IConvertible, ISerializable, IComparable<DateTime>, IEquatable<DateTime>
{
    // Contains methods and properties  
}
```
DateTime helps developer to find out more information about Date and Time like Get month, day, year, week day. It also helps to find date difference, add number of days to a date, etc.

### Standard DateTime Formatting
DateTimeFormatInfo specifies a set of specifiers for simple date and time formatting. Every specifier correspond to
a particular DateTimeFormatInfo format pattern.
```csarp
//Create datetime
DateTime dt = new DateTime(2016, 08, 01, 18, 50, 23, 230);
var t = String.Format("{0:t}", dt);     // "6:50 PM" ShortTime
var d = String.Format("{0:d}", dt);     // "8/1/2016" ShortDate
var T = String.Format("{0:T}", dt);     // "6:50:23 PM" LongTime
var D = String.Format("{0:D}", dt);     // "Monday, August 1, 2016" LongDate
var f = String.Format("{0:f}", dt);     // "Monday, August 1, 2016 6:50 PM" LongDate+ShortTime
var F = String.Format("{0:F}", dt);     // "Monday, August 1, 2016 6:50:23 PM" FullDateTime
var g = String.Format("{0:g}", dt);     // "8/1/2016 6:50 PM" ShortDate+ShortTime
var G = String.Format("{0:G}", dt);     // "8/1/2016 6:50:23 PM" ShortDate+LongTime
var m = String.Format("{0:m}", dt);     // "August 1" MonthDay
var y = String.Format("{0:y}", dt);     // "August 2016" YearMonth
var r = String.Format("{0:r}", dt);     // "SMon, 01 Aug 2016 18:50:23 GMT" RFC1123
var s = String.Format("{0:s}", dt);     // "2016-08-01T18:50:23" SortableDateTime
var u = String.Format("{0:u}", dt);     // "2016-08-01 18:50:23Z" UniversalSortableDateTime
```
#### Custom DateTime Formatting
There are following custom format specifiers:
-y (year)
-M (month)
-d (day)
-h (hour 12)
-H (hour 24)
-m (minute)
-s (second)
-f (second fraction)
-F (second fraction, trailing zeroes are trimmed)
-t (P.M or A.M)
-z (time zone)

```csharp
var year = String.Format("{0:y yy yyy yyyy}", dt);      // "16 16 2016 2016" year
var month = String.Format("{0:M MM MMM MMMM}", dt);     // "8 08 Aug August" month
var day = String.Format("{0:d dd ddd dddd}", dt);       // "1 01 Mon Monday" day
var hour = String.Format("{0:h hh H HH}", dt);          // "6 06 18 18" hour 12/24
var minute = String.Format("{0:m mm}", dt);             // "50 50" minute
var secound = String.Format("{0:s ss}", dt);            // "23 23" second
var fraction = String.Format("{0:f ff fff ffff}", dt);  // "2 23 230 2300" sec.fraction
var fraction2 = String.Format("{0:F FF FFF FFFF}", dt); // "2 23 23 23" without zeroes
var period = String.Format("{0:t tt}", dt);             // "P PM" A.M. or P.M.
var zone = String.Format("{0:z zz zzz}", dt);           // "+0 +00 +00:00" time zone
```
### DateTime Formatting

Different users need different kinds of  format date. For instance some users need date like "mm/dd/yyyy", some need "dd-mm-yyyy". Let's say current Date Time is "12/8/2015 3:15:19 PM" and as per specifier you will get below output.
```csharp
DateTime tempDate = new DateTime(2015, 12, 08);         // creating date object with 8th December 2015  
Console.WriteLine(tempDate.ToString("MMMM dd, yyyy"));  //December 08, 2105.  
```
Below specifiers will help you to get the date in different formats.

| Specifier | Description | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d | Short Date |	12/8/2015 |
| D | Long Date |	Tuesday, December 08, 2015 |
| t | Short Time |	3:15 PM |
| T | Long Time |	3:15:19 PM |
| f | Full date and time |	Tuesday, December 08, 2015 3:15 PM |
| F | Full date and time (long) |	Tuesday, December 08, 2015 3:15:19 PM |
| g | Default date and time |	12/8/2015 15:15 |
| G | Default date and time (long) |	12/8/2015 15:15 |
| M | Day / Month |	8-Dec |
| r | RFC1123 date |	Tue, 08 Dec 2015 15:15:19 GMT |
| s | Sortable date/time |	2015-12-08T15:15:19 |
| u | Universal time, local timezone |	2015-12-08 15:15:19Z |
| Y | Month / Year |	December, 2015 |
| dd | Day | 8 |
| ddd |	Short Day Name | Tue |
| dddd |	Full Day Name |	Tuesday |
| hh | 2 digit hour | 3 |
| HH | 2 digit hour (24 hour) | 15 |
| mm | 2 digit minute | 15 |
| MM | Month |	12|
| MMM | Short Month name | Dec |
| MMMM | Month name | December |
| ss | seconds | 19 |
| fff |	milliseconds | 120 |
| FFF |	milliseconds without trailing zero | 12 |
| tt | AM/PM | PM |
| yy | 2 digit year | 15 |
| yyyy |	4 digit year| 2015 |
| : | Hours, minutes, seconds separator, e.g. {0:hh:mm:ss} | 9:08:59 |
| / | Year, month , day separator, e.g. {0:dd/MM/yyyy} | 8/4/2007 |

### DateTime Parsing

Sometimes we do parsing from string to DateTime object to perform operations like date difference, weekday, month name etc. For instance, there is a string value (“12/10/2015”) and our requirement is to find out weekday (Sunday or Monday and so on) of date. In this scenario we need to convert string value to DateTime object and then use WeekDay property(obj.WeekDay) to find out weekday. We can accomplish the same by built-in methods like Convert.ToDateTime(), DateTime.Parse(), DateTime.ParseExact(), DateTime.TryParse(), DateTime.TryParseExact(). Here are a few examples of how to parse a string to DateTime object:

#### ParseExact
```csharp
var dateString = "2015-11-24";
var date = DateTime.ParseExact(dateString, "yyyy-MM-dd", null);
Console.WriteLine(date);  //11/24/2015 12:00:00 AM
```
Note that passing CultureInfo.CurrentCulture as the third parameter is identical to passing null. Or, you can
pass a specific culture. Input string can be in any format that matches the format string.
```csharp
var date = DateTime.ParseExact("24|201511", "dd|yyyyMM", null);
Console.WriteLine(date);  //11/24/2015 12:00:00 AM

//Case matters for format specifiers
var date = DateTime.ParseExact("2015-01-24 11:11:30", "yyyy-mm-dd hh:MM:ss", null);
Console.WriteLine(date);    //11/24/2015 11:01:30 AM
```
Note that the month and minute values were parsed into the wrong destinations.

#### TryParse
This method accepts a string as input, attempts to parse it into a DateTime, and returns a Boolean result indicating
success or failure. If the call succeeds, the variable passed as the out parameter is populated with the parsed result.
If the parse fails, the variable passed as the out parameter is set to the default value, DateTime.MinValue.
TryParse(string, out DateTime)
```csharp
DateTime parsedValue;
if (DateTime.TryParse("monkey", out parsedValue))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Apparently, 'monkey' is a date/time value. Who knew?");
}
```
This method attempts to parse the input string based on the system regional settings and known formats such as ISO 8601 and other common formats.
```csharp
DateTime.TryParse("11/24/2015 14:28:42", out parsedValue);       // true
DateTime.TryParse("2015-11-24 14:28:42", out parsedValue);       // true
DateTime.TryParse("2015-11-24T14:28:42", out parsedValue);       // true
DateTime.TryParse("Sat, 24 Nov 2015 14:28:42", out parsedValue); // true
```
TryParse(string, IFormatProvider, DateTimeStyles, out DateTime)

```csharp
if (DateTime.TryParse(" monkey ", new CultureInfo("en-GB"),
 DateTimeStyles.AllowLeadingWhite | DateTimeStyles.AllowTrailingWhite, out parsedValue)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Apparently, ' monkey ' is a date/time value. Who knew?");
}
```
Unlike its sibling method, this overload allows a specific culture and style(s) to be specified. Passing **null** for the
**IFormatProvider** parameter uses the system culture.

Exceptions

Note that it is possible for this method to throw an exception under certain conditions. These relate to the
parameters introduced for this overload: **IFormatProvider** and **DateTimeStyles**.
- `NotSupportedException`: `IFormatProvider` specifies a neutral culture
- `ArgumentException`: `DateTimeStyles` is not a valid option, or contains incompatible flags such as
  `AssumeLocal` and `AssumeUniversal`.

#### TryParseExact

This method behaves as a combination of TryParse and ParseExact: It allows custom format(s) to be specified, and returns a Boolean result indicating success or failure rather than throwing an exception if the parse fails.
**TryParseExact(string, string, IFormatProvider, DateTimeStyles, out DateTime)**
This overload attempts to parse the input string against a specific format. The input string must match that format in order to be parsed.
```csharp
DateTime.TryParseExact("11242015", "MMddyyyy", null, DateTimeStyles.None, out parsedValue); // true
```
**TryParseExact(string, string[], IFormatProvider, DateTimeStyles, out DateTime)**
This overload attempts to parse the input string against an array of formats. The input string must match at least
one format in order to be parsed.
```csharp
DateTime.TryParseExact("11242015", new [] { "yyyy-MM-dd", "MMddyyyy" }, null, DateTimeStyles.None, out parsedValue); // true
```

Now a question arises in your mind, that is, why do we have so many methods for parsing? The reason is every method is for a different purpose. Use TryParse() when you want to be able to attempt a parse and handle invalid data immediately (instead of throwing the exception), and ParseExact() when the format you are expecting is not a standard format, or when you want to limit to one particular standard format for efficiency. If you're sure the string is a valid DateTime, and you know the format, you could also consider the DateTime.ParseExact() or DateTime.TryParseExact() methods.

#### Pure functions warning when dealing with DateTime

Wikipedia currently defines a pure function as follows:

1. The function always evaluates the same result value given the same argument value(s). The function result
value cannot depend on any hidden information or state that may change while program execution proceeds
or between different executions of the program, nor can it depend on any external input from I/O devices .

2. Evaluation of the result does not cause any semantically observable side effect or output, such as mutation
of mutable objects or output to I/O devices
As a developer you need to be aware of pure methods and you will stumble upon these a lot in many areas. One I
have seen that bites many junior developers is working with DateTime class methods. A lot of these are pure and if
you are unaware of these you can be in for a suprise. An example:
```csharp
DateTime sample = new DateTime(2016, 12, 25);
sample.AddDays(1);
Console.WriteLine(sample.ToShortDateString());
```
Given the example above one may expect the result printed to console to be '26/12/2016' but in reality you end up with the same date. This is because AddDays is a pure method and does not affect the original date. To get the expected output you would have to modify the AddDays call to the following:
```csharp
sample = sample.AddDays(1)
```

## Keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved identifiers with special meaning to the compiler. They cannot be used as
identifiers in your program without the @ prefix. For example @if is a legal identifier but not the keyword if.

#### as

The as keyword is an operator similar to a cast. If a cast is not possible, using as produces null rather than
resulting in an ```InvalidCastException```.
Expression ```as``` type is equivalent to expression ```is``` type ? ```(type)expression : (type)null``` with the caveat that
as is only valid on reference conversions, nullable conversions, and boxing conversions. User-defined conversions
are not supported; a regular cast must be used instead. For the expansion above, the compiler generates code such 
that expression will only be evaluated once and use single dynamic type check (unlike the two in the sample above).
```as``` can be useful when expecting an argument to facilitate several types. Specifically it grants the user multiple
options - rather than checking every possibility with is before casting, or just casting and catching exceptions. It is
best practice to use 'as' when casting/checking an object which will cause only one unboxing penalty. Using is to check, 
then casting will cause two unboxing penalties.

If an argument is expected to be an instance of a specific type, a regular cast is preferred as its purpose is more
clear to the reader. Because a call to as may produce null, always check the result to avoid a NullReferenceException.

```csharp
object something = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(something as string); //Hello
Console.Writeline(something as Nullable<int>); //null
Console.WriteLine(something as int?); //null

//This does NOT compile:
//destination type must be a reference type (or a nullable value type)
Console.WriteLine(something as int);
```
Equivalent example without using as:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(something is string ? (string)something : (string)null);
```
This is useful when overriding the Equals function in custom classes.
```csharp
class MyCustomClass
{
    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        MyCustomClass customObject = obj as MyCustomClass;
        // if it is null it may be really null
        // or it may be of a different type
        if (Object.ReferenceEquals(null, customObject))
        {
            // If it is null then it is not equal to this instance.
            return false;
        }
        // Other equality controls specific to class
    }
}
```
